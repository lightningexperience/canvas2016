    <p>Hello, <%= context.user.firstName %>. Hi There! This is a web app written in Node.js embedded in your Salesforce page (It could also be written in any other language).</p>
    <p>It is aware of its environment. For example, here are a few things it knows:</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td>User:</td><td><%= context.user.fullName %></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Object:</td><td><%= context.environment.record.attributes.type %></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Id:</td><td><%= context.environment.record.Id %></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>It can also access more data in Salesforce using the REST APIs. With context and APIs, Canvas makes it easy to integrate applications written in any language inside your Salesforce pages.</p>
    <p>For example, the QR Code below is generated in Node.js. Scan it to create a contact on your mobile phone:</p>

    Hi There - This is Faizi. I have modified the original code to embed a pdf document here using this tutorial: https://pdfobject.com/static.html
    
    <object data="https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample-3pp.pdf#page=2" type="application/pdf" height="100%" width="100%">
<iframe src="https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample-3pp.pdf#page=2" style="border: none;" height="100%" width="100%">
This browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: <a href="/pdf/sample-3pp.pdf">Download PDF</a>
</iframe>
</object>

The above approach doesn't work. 

Testing with a file uploaded to github repo which is connected to the heroku app.
